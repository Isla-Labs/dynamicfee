# DynamicFee

A gas-efficient, zero-dependency library for dynamic fee calculation with exponential decay. Fee rates decline as transaction volume increases, within configurable tiers.

## Formula

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| ϕ | Calculated fee rate (output, in basis points) |
| v | Transaction volume (input) |
| f_min | Minimum fee floor (e.g. 1% = 100 bps) |
| v_start | Starting volume threshold for the current tier |
| ϕ_start | Initial fee value at tier start (bps) |
| α | Decay factor for the current tier |
| e | Euler's number |
| κ | Scale parameter (1000) |

```
ϕ(v) = f_min + (ϕ_start - f_min) ⋅ e^(−α ⋅ (v−v_start) / κ)
```

The fee rate decays exponentially as transaction volume increases. Four predefined tiers each have their own `v_start`, `ϕ_start`, and `α`. The only variable input is transaction volume for fetching the variable fee rate output.

## Variants

### DynamicFeeUsd

USD-denominated tiers via Chainlink ETH/USD price feed. Stable fee tiers regardless of ETH price.

- **Tiers:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses 0 USD, 500 USD, 5_000 USD, 50_000 USD
- **Fee bounds:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses 5.00% max → 1.00% min
- **Alpha values:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses variable decay factors for each volume tier (100, 120, 50, 100)
- **Fallback:** Uses `FALLBACK_ETH_PRICE` when feed is stale or unavailable (e.g. testnets)

Use when you want volume-based tiers in USD terms.

### DynamicFeeEth

ETH-denominated tiers. No oracle required.

- **Tiers:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses 0, 2 ETH, 20 ETH, 200 ETH
- **Fee bounds:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses 2.00% max (low volume) → 0.60% min (high volume)
- **Alpha values:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses variable decay factors for each volume tier (300, 50, 100, 300)

Use when you want simple, trustless fee logic without external price feeds.

### DynamicFeeLib

Library version (ETH-denominated tiers only). No oracle available.

- **Tiers:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses 0, 2 ETH, 20 ETH, 200 ETH
- **Fee bounds:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses 2.00% max (low volume) → 0.60% min (high volume)
- **Alpha values:** Fully configurable; placeholder uses variable decay factors for each volume tier (300, 50, 100, 300)

Use when you want a simple, trustless dynamic fee library without external price feeds.

## Features

- **Zero dependencies** — Custom `ExponentialMathLib` for e^(-x/1000) (Taylor series + range reduction); no prb-math or other libs
- **Gas-efficient** — Pure library (`DynamicFeeLib`) for stateless calculation; abstract contracts for integration
- **Configurable** — Tier thresholds, decay factors, and fee bounds are constants you can tune
- **Oracle-optional** — `DynamicFeeEth` needs no oracle; `DynamicFeeUsd` uses Chainlink with staleness fallback

## Contracts

| Contract | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `DynamicFeeLib` | Library | Pure fee calculation; volume in ETH wei |
| `DynamicFeeEth` | Abstract | ETH-denominated; inherit and implement |
| `DynamicFeeUsd` | Abstract | USD-denominated; Chainlink + fallback |
| `ExponentialMathLib` | Library | e^(-x/1000) with 18-decimal precision |

Latest deployments can be found [here](./Deployments.md) and historical deployment logs can be found in the [deployments](./deployments/) folder.

## Getting Started

Install Foundry: `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && source ~/.bashrc && foundryup`

```bash
forge build
forge test
forge fmt
```

## Deployment Instructions

Deploy ExponentialMathLib first, then deploy DynamicFeeLib, DynamicFeeEth, and/or DynamicFeeUsd. You can deploy all at once or choose specific contracts.

```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env and set PRIVATE_KEY, RPC URLs, and API keys
cp .env.example .env

# Deploy all (exp + lib + eth + usd)
make deploy-ethereum          # Ethereum
make deploy-ethereum-sepolia  # Ethereum Sepolia
make deploy-base              # Base
make deploy-base-sepolia      # Base Sepolia
make deploy-arbitrum          # Arbitrum
make deploy-arbitrum-sepolia  # Arbitrum Sepolia

# Deploy individually (Base Sepolia used for demonstration)
make deploy-base-sepolia-exp   # ExponentialMathLib only
make deploy-base-sepolia-lib   # DynamicFeeLib
make deploy-base-sepolia-eth   # DynamicFeeEth
make deploy-base-sepolia-usd   # DynamicFeeUsd
```

For usd targets, Chainlink ETH/USD addresses are set per network in the scripts.
